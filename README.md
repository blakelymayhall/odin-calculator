# odin-calculator
Repo for the foundations course capstone project to create a web-browser calculator 

## Description
Create a UI browser-based calculator as the capstone project for the fundamentals odin-project in full-stack webdev.  

The calculator should be functional, and pretty, able to at a minimum add, subtract, divide, and multiply. 

Order of operations for basic four-function calculators should be implemented (i.e. do one operation at a time).

## MVP reached 6/28
This check in includes tested and robust functionality of the calculator operations. Does not include decimal or backspace, that will come in an iteration on MVP
